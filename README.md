# ReactStore.NET
.NET and React implementation of an online store.


This is the tutorial implementation of the React store from the Udemy course
https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-build-an-e-commerce-store-with-dotnet-react-redux/


The app uses .NET 6 for it's backend while using React with Redux and Redux-tools librarys for it's frontend. It uses Stripe as a payment processor.
As this is a simple tutorial intended for learning it uses a simple Sqlite file to store data.


Unlike the the tutorial it does not use Cloudinary to host images of the store. It simply stores uploaded product images on the server and retrieves them when required.
